# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 16th, 2024 - Setting Up My Environment 

**Today's Progress**: I created my goals and set up my accounts. I am using GitHub, FreeCodeCamp, and documenting here with the 100 days of code. 

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed getting everything together. I chose Scientific Computing with Python on FCC and did the first 5 lessons.

### Day 1: August 17th, 2024 - 5 - 40 Scientific Computing with Python on FCC 

**Today's Progress**: Session 1 of Coding I made progress doing modules 5-40 and setting up the journal for 100 Days of Code Progress. 
                      Session 2 of Coding later in the day I did modules 40-61. These grew to be a bit tougher for me as I began building on to the knowledge. I want to believe I was                                     trying to over complicate a simple concept and read too much into it. The kid is on the same module and it is nice to work with him on these                                             concepts. When I began programming before, my brain would get frazzeled and I would feel stuck. Eventually, I would give into temptaion and falter                                       with progress.  
**Thoughts**: Some of the scenarios were vague at points, yet, I worked through them, and I am starting to understand things a bit better. As well I convinced my kid to join me and now we are learning the course together.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
